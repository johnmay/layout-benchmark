# Layout Benchmark

A collection of chemical structures for which generating a 2D layout can be difficult. The set is based on that described in Clark, A et al. 2006 around key obstacles:

 * Find Optimal Solution - avoidable overlaps
 * Suboptimal Solution - unavoidable overlaps
 * Global Chain Blocks
 * Double Bond Stereochemistry
 * Congested Small Rings
 * Bonding Counterions
 * Spirocenters
 * Macrocycles
 * Ring Template Matches
 * Planar Embedding
 * 3D Ring Systems
